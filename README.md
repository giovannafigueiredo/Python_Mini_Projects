# Simple computer quiz game

#### This Application is a simple quiz that was originally made using a small Python script. However, I felt the necessity of creating a front end for this quiz, instead of always using the terminal in VS Code. 


As soon as you run the app, you should be able to see the following:

If you type "yes" the questions will be shown to you:

After you finish responding all questions in the quiz, there will be a message in the end telling you how many questions you answered correctly and your score in percentage.
